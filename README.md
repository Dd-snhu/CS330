How do I approach designing software?

When I start a program, I figure out what needs to be done to have a functional program. I then begin adding different functions and testing each one to make sure the new code did not create bugs in the old code. In this code, I became better at modularizing. I was able to enter the raw data and then enter the commands to have the program take of the rest for me. 


How do I approach developing programs?

This program had a lot of iteration to draw different aspects of the scene. I wanted to make sure that was automated as much as possible to let me focus on getting the object placement right. In the beginning I started with just having functional code and was adding several lines of code in different places to get everything working. Once it was modularized and automated, I just had to add a few lines for each object and the program took care of the rest. 


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

In this class I learned a lot about figuring out how something new to me could be used to make different things. I learned how to research what different things did and how information needed to be passed to allow everything to work. It was fun to learn how to use OpenGL to create the scene. This class has shown me that in the future I can learn how to use different applications to do different things and integrate them with code.
